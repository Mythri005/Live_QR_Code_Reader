# QR & Barcode Scanner with Logging

This Python project uses OpenCV and Pyzbar to scan QR codes and barcodes in real-time through your webcam. 
Each scanned code is logged with a timestamp in a daily log file, and smart actions like opening URLs or identifying UPI links are supported. 
It features a live camera feed with bounding boxes and labels; press 'q' to exit.
